title: Interactive Demo

\rules except wikilink

Obviously, interactive uglifying like you're seeing here is only for this demo. In practice, //Uglify// does all of its compression either during the Node.JS server boot process, or during a save in the case of standalone TiddlyWikis.

And of course //Uglify// [[caches whenever it can|Caching]]. Compression is expensive!

[[...Although you can programmatically uglify tiddlers if you want to|API]].
