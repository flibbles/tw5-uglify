//Uglify// introduces one wikimethod.

''getTiddlerCompressedText(title)''

Given a tiddler title, it will return its text in the most compressed way it can. That means if it's javascript, it will be minified javascript. If it's a plugin, it will be compressed, and all internal files will be compressed.

This method works even if compression is disabled. However, it won't be present on the browser if [[plugin stubbing|Stubbing]] is enabled.
