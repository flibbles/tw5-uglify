This pruning rule scraps everything it can that exclusively runs on Node.JS. This includes command-line tools, server-specific utilities, and http request handlers (and all associated language tiddlers). You don't //need// any of this stuff on the browser or in your standalone tiddlywikis, and it all just takes up space.

This rule should always be safe to enable when generating tiddlywikis, but if you're publishing a plugin, this rule would strip any `routes`, `commands`, or `utils-node` modules out of your plugin while uglifying it.

For this reason, apart from the //Uglify// wizard webpage, this rule is disabled by default.
