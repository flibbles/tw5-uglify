title: Creating Plugins in the Browser

[[The TiddlyWiki development website outlines how to make plugins in TiddlyWiki itself.|https://tiddlywiki.com/dev/static/How%2520to%2520create%2520plugins%2520in%2520the%2520browser.html]] but trying to compress them there is problematic.

First, it involves <$link to="Uglify on TiddlyWiki">installing //Uglify// into your TiddlyWiki file</$link>. Then every single time you repack your plugin, TiddlyWiki will refresh //all// plugins, which will force //Uglify// to recompress them all. So at the very least, you need to [[disable compression|Toggling Compression]] while you work.

But even then, TiddlyWiki will merge your javascript modules into your plugin, and once you finally do compress, you'll lose the originals, because `$tw.utils.repackPlugin` deletes the your javascript tiddlers, leaving only the shadows, which are compressed and uneditable.

Frankly, I don't recommend doing this. If you want to generate compressed plugins, use git and Node.JS as outlined above.
