This pruning rule scraps everything concerning tiddler editing. This includes creating and deleting tiddlers as well. This rule is useful for tiddlywikis which are intended to be customer-facing or in some way "complete", and require no further editing.

Tiddlers can still be modified through actions and messages (such as through buttons or automated behavior).

Currently, this rule is somewhat conservative with what it removes to avoid over-pruning, but if you think any remaining shadow tiddlers can also be scrapped, please feel free to let me know.
