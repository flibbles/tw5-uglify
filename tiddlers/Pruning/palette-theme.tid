This pruning rule removes all unused palettes and themes, as well as the infrastructure to modify them. In short, it commits your tiddlywiki to whatever appearance customization it already has.

This is useful for production-ready tiddlywikis that have already been customized.

(The below list of removed tiddlers includes all non-vanilla palettes, but in reality, this rule will keep whatever palette your wiki is using.)
