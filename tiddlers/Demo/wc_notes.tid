//Uglify// utilizes [[UglifyJS|https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS]] to compress a plugin's javascript down to their minimum size. Unlike other compressers which would need to preserve the long preambles containing a file's fields, //Uglify// can dispose of them since compression happens after the fields have been imported.
