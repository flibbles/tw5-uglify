Configure which directory //Uglify// will create when `--savesourcemaps` is called, and also what directory generated Tiddlywikis and tiddlywikicore files will look into to source map their javascript.

This value is a filter, which allows you to make the directory name dynamic based on certain circumstances, such as your Tiddlywiki version. For instance `sourceDirectory=[[source-]addsuffix<version>]`.

The directory can be absolute (`/`), or it can step out of your output directory (`..`). These are advanced tricks though, that will depend on your particular directory setup, and may require moving generated files around.
